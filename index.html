        Although some of the original ideas about the Museum changed over time, many of the initial elements remained constant.  The concept of a large glass studio, where visitors could watch artists create art from molten glass, was an integral part of the original plan-and the Hot Shop Amphitheater, located inside the 90-foot tall steel cone, fulfills that description today.  The Museum was envisioned as a center that would nurture artists, celebrate the dramatic new Studio Glass movement and encourage creativity.  This vision is realized through the exhibitions in the galleries, the art installations on the outdoor plazas, the hands-on art studio, and the Museum's diverse educational programs, as well as the Hot Shop.
        Today, the Museum's stainless steel cone serves as a beacon to a stunning contemporary art museum as well as a symbol for the restoration of a waterway and the revitalization of a city.

        Washington Union Station is a major train station, transportation hub, and leisure destination in Washington, D.C. Opened in 1907, it is Amtrak's headquarters and the railroad's second-busiest station with annual ridership of just under 5 million. The station also serves MARC and VRE commuter rail services, the Washington Metro, and buses.  At the height of its traffic, during World War II, as many as 200,000 passengers passed through the station in a single day. In 1988, a headhouse wing was added and the original station renovated for use as a shopping mall. Today, Union Station is one of the busiest rail facilities and shopping destinations in the country, and is visited by over 40 million people a year.

      The Waterwalk at Point Ruston is the medium through which people connect and enjoy the unobstructed Puget Sound waterfront. This dynamic pedestrian-only esplanade, spanning the entire waterfront of the Point Ruston neighborhood, connects Tacoma's Pt. Defiance Park with Ruston Way and Downtown Tacoma. The Waterwalk provides countless recreational opportunities, accented by thoughtfully appointed benches, manicured gardens, inspired playgrounds and a wide variety of northwest-inspired large-scale mosaics.
